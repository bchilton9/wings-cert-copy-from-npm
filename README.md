# update-wings-certs.sh

A simple script to automatically update the SSL certificate used by the Pterodactyl Wings daemon based on the latest Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates.

___

## Purpose

This script ensures that the Wings daemon uses the most up-to-date SSL certificates issued by Nginx Proxy Manager for secure panel-to-node communication over HTTPS.

___

## How it works:
	‚Ä¢	Copies fullchain.pem and privkey.pem from NPM‚Äôs certificate directory
	‚Ä¢	Places them into Wings‚Äô cert directory (like /etc/pterodactyl/certs)
	‚Ä¢	Restarts Wings so it picks up the new certificates

___

## Script Paths

Make sure to set the paths in the script:

CERT_SRC=‚Äú/path/to/your/npm/certs‚Äù
CERT_DST=‚Äú/path/to/store/your/wings/certs‚Äù

___

## Manual usage:

Run this as root:
```
sudo ./update-wings-certs.sh
```

___

## Automatic usage with cron:

Edit root‚Äôs crontab:
```
sudo crontab -e
```
Add this line to run it every day at 3:15 AM:
```
15 3 * * * /root/update-wings-certs.sh
```

___

## Wings must be configured to use the following paths or the paths in the script changed:

SSL Certificate:
/etc/pterodactyl/certs/fullchain.pem

SSL Private Key:
/etc/pterodactyl/certs/privkey.pem
