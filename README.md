# update-wings-certs.sh

A simple script to keep Pterodactyl Wings’ SSL certificates updated from Nginx Proxy Manager.

___

## Why this is needed:

Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) creates symlinks in /etc/letsencrypt/live/ that point to versioned files in /etc/letsencrypt/archive/.
Pterodactyl Wings does not properly follow these symlinks, which can cause TLS connection failures after cert renewals.
This script copies the actual .pem files (not symlinks), ensuring Wings always has a valid and direct copy.

___

## How it works:
	•	Copies fullchain.pem and privkey.pem from NPM’s certificate directory
	•	Places them into Wings’ cert directory (like /etc/pterodactyl/certs)
	•	Restarts Wings so it picks up the new certificates

___

## Script Paths

Make sure to set the paths in the script:

CERT_SRC=“/path/to/your/npm/certs”
CERT_DST=“/etc/pterodactyl/certs/“

___

## Wings must be configured to use the following paths or the paths in the script changed:

SSL Certificate:
/etc/pterodactyl/certs/fullchain.pem

SSL Private Key:
/etc/pterodactyl/certs/privkey.pem

___

## Manual usage:

Run this as root:
```
sudo ./update-wings-certs.sh
```

___

## Automatic usage with cron (Optional):

Edit root’s crontab:
```
sudo crontab -e
```
Add this line to run it every day at 3:15 AM:
```
15 3 * * * /root/update-wings-certs.sh
```
